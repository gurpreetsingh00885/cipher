# cipher
This is my first android app that generates ciphertext and can also be used to decipher it. It doesn't use any existing cipher to do this.

Help on how to use the app is available inside the app itself.

The algorithm is similar to Caesar Cipher. However the process is repeated over and over again several number of times so that the app can generate multiple ciphertext versions of given text.
